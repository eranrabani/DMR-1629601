centerAtomSymbol = Se (Cd is default - use XX for no center)
nMaxBonds = 4 (CdSe/CdS/ZnS/..)
buildNewNC = 1 (0 -> false is default - must be followed immediately by ncType and size)
ncType = NPL (QD is default (QD, NR, NPL or attachedNCs) - must be below buildNewNC and nCores
nCores = 1 (0 -> false is default (0,1,2,...) - bulk crystal built with lattice constant of the mainNC)

nAttachedNCs = 2 (0 -> false is default (1,3) - bulk crystal built with lattice constant of the mainNC)
